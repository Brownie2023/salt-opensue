Vagrant openSUSE SaltStack

1. Installed Vagrant 1.8.7 for OS X from https://www.vagrantup.com/
2. Cloned  https://github.com/UtahDave/salt-vagrant-demo
3. ran 'vagrant up' and received errors:
  - /opt/vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-1.8.7/plugins/provisioners/salt/provisioner.rb:9: warning: wrong element type String at 0 (expected array)
    /opt/vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-1.8.7/plugins/provisioners/salt/provisioner.rb:9: warning: ignoring wrong elements is deprecated, remove them explicitly
    ...
4. Fixed by downgrading to Vagrant 1.8.6
  - Remember to remove /opt/vagrant on OS X (vagrant should include this in their docs)
5. Ran 'vagrant up'
  - SUCCESS
5.1 - decided to move over to my windows desktop and run opensuse servers in vagrant
  - installed vagrant 1.8.6
  - switched Vagrantfile master_config.vm.box && minion_config.vm.box to "bento/opensuse-leap-42.1"
  - ran 'vagrant up'
  - used putty to ssh into master and minions
6. /var/log/salt/master && /var/cache/salt permission issues running salt commands
  - rather than dealing with permissions I just switched to su
7. ssh into master & minions:
  master - ssh 192.168.50.10 -l vagrant
  minion1 - ssh 192.168.50.11 -l vagrant
  minion2 - ssh 192.168.50.12 -l vagrant
8. nettools.sls && examples.sls created while going over the tutorial @ https://docs.saltstack.com/en/getstarted/fundamentals/index.html
9. THE GOAL:
  - create a web app on server(minion1) that connects to a separate db server(minion2)
10. web_services.web_services.sls:
  - need to automate the install of apache and pythons pip
  - pip needs to install the flask and sqlalchemy packages for out to-do app
11. web_services.vhost.sls:
  - push example_site.conf file for virtual host to /etc/apache2/vhost.d/
12. web_services.site.sls:
  - push flask app(site dir) to /srv/www/htdocs/
13. postgres.postgres_service.sls:
  - install postgres 9.4 server and run service
  - need to automate setting up new user and db for app


TO-DO
11. automate dbs and user setup on minion2
12. Set up flask app to point to minion2 postgres install and db.
  - probably a simple  to-do app

NEED TO LOOK AT APACHE2 CONFIGURATION, IT DIFFERS FROM APACHE!
